Need to install the following packages:
  solidity-coverage@0.8.16
Ok to proceed? (y) 
⚠️  solidity-coverage >= 0.7.0 is no longer a shell command. ⚠️
=============================================================

Instead, you should use the plugin produced for your development stack
(like Hardhat) or design a custom workflow using the package API

> See https://github.com/sc-forks/solidity-coverage for help with configuration.

Thanks! - sc-forks
